An analog clock is a traditional timekeeping device that displays the current time using the positions of hour, minute, and second hands on a circular dial. They are known for their classic design and are often used for decorative purposes. The motion of the clock hands provides a visual representation of the passage of time, making analog clocks a familiar and functional timekeeping tool.
